# Mean_Variance_Sector_Rotation
We transform a large library of price–volume indicators into continuous factors via bespoke smoothing operators, retain only those with persistent rolling IC, and on an 8:1:1 split deploy Bayesian search over rebalancing cadence, lookback, and forecast horizon, feeding constrained mean–variance optimisation to deliver T+1 allocations.
